## Description
CardGames is a web game for those who forgot their playing cards, but stil wants to play a card game. It is going to be a multiplayer game so everyone has their own deck on their phone so no one can see wich cards you have.

***
## Usages
For my frontend I use Vite + VueJs. For my backend I am going to use C# (not in my project yet). Because everyone needs to be talking to eachother, but still needs to be in sync, I am going to use WebSockets.
