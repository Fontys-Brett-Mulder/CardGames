# What is Security?

Security stands for "the state of being free from danger or threat". If you can walk on the streets, and you are feeling
safe because someone is protecting you, you feel secure (Security). In Applications, it has another meaning. Let me
explain.

# Security and Development

As it comes to Security and Development, Security has another meaning. When you create an account on a website, you want
your data to be safe and secure. This can be done using password hashing, authentication and a lot more.

# 7 things to make your website more secure

***

## 1. Install SSL

### What is SSL?

The easiest thing to do to protect your website, users and yourself, is to install SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)
certificate. You can check if your, or other websites use SSL by looking at the url. When the url starts with "https"
instead of "http", it has an SSL certificate.

### What does SSL do?

SSL encrypts information passing between your website and your visitors. Google now warns visitors when they’re entering
a site without SSL, and even “discriminates” against those sites in its search results.

It’s especially important to have SSL security if you’re accepting payments through your site, asking for login details,
or transferring files. Without it, the data is unprotected, and vulnerable to hackers.

## 2. Use anti-malware software

Anti-malware software sounds like a lot, but it actually gets done for you. It keeps viruses away from your laptop/pc,
this way no one can steal information from your local machine. This software creates Free SSL, Hack Protection,
Automatic backups, DDoS protection and a lot more.

### List of anti-malware software

- Norton
- McAfee
- Bitdefender

And there are a lot more.

## 3. Make your passwords uncrackable

Passwords are thins you use every day, but are your passwords as secure as you think they are? Lets start.

Most people uses their name inside their passwords, and on the end they add their date of birth. For example: "
Peter2022". Hackers can easily hack this kind of passwords. Hackers are going to search for you on social media, then
they see your name and sometimes also your date of birth. Now they try your passwords in multiple ways. For example: "
Peter2022", "peter2022", "Peter202210", "Peter2022!". You may think, this would them take a lot of time trying all those
passwords, but it is not when they use an automated script.

### How to make your passwords secure?

1. Try creating new ones with for example with no date of birth but with a special date only you know. Make sure this
   date is nowhere on social media or something
2. Do not use your name in it, maybe the name of your dog, and you combined. For example "PeFy2012". "Pe": **Pe**ter, "
   Fy": Fluf**fy**. And after that the date of birth from your dog or something.
3. Use special characters like: !, ?, ., #, :, -, $... What you want. For exaple: "PeFy2015!#"
4. Use random capital letters
5. Do not use the same password over and over again

On the end we have our new password: **PeFy2015!#**

### How to create a much more secure password?

when you want to use a much secure password you can use tools
like [Lastpass](https://www.lastpass.com/features/password-generator). You can create passwords completely random. When
you use such passwords I recommend using a tool to keep those passwords safe. For example [KeePass](https://keepass.info/).
