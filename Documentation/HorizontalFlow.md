# How does my flow looks like
1. Creating a new User Story and all its needs
2. Creating tickets/features for this User Story
3. Creating a new branch using GitFlow
4. Start developing
5. After developing create a Test (if needed)
6. Pushing everything to your branch
7. Testing your feature with GitHub Actions
8. Create a pull request to the dev branch
9. Move the ticket to do 
10. Moving your new version to the live version 
11. If the user story is done, mark the user story on the board as done
